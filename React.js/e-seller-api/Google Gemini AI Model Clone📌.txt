Google Gemini AI Model CloneðŸ“Œ

I'm thrilled to share that after 5 days of focused work, I've successfully completed my latest project-a clone of the Google Gemini AI model! ðŸŒŸ

In this project, I leveraged Google Gemini 1.5 Flash and utilized the predefined React package `@google/generative-ai` to build the core functionality. I also generated the API key using Google AI Studio to seamlessly integrate the model. The user interface was crafted with React.js for a smooth and intuitive experience.ðŸš€

You can check out the live demo here: [ https://google-ai-gemini.netlify.app ]

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into generative AI and further hone my skills in full-stack development. Iâ€™m excited about the potential applications of this technology and look forward to exploring more innovative AI-driven projects!
